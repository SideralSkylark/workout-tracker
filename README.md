# Workout tracker spring boot app
This app is designed to help track progress in the gym, for the time beign it will simply allow you to devise a split and register the work done each session. This project comes from a need of mine to keep track of such metrics in a way of avoiding the use of pen and paper, for it becomes far too taxing to keep track of such data using it.

## Functional requirements
- **Create a split**;
- **Mannage an existing split**
- **Register sets and reps during a given session**
